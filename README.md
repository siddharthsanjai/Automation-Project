# Automation-Project

This repository contains a home automation project designed to control household appliances and devices remotely. The core script, Automation_Code, likely implements features for managing lights, fans, or other home elements through code, possibly integrating with hardware like microcontrollers or IoT devices.

## Project Overview

Home automation projects enable users to monitor and control various aspects of their living spaces efficiently. This project focuses on automating routine tasks such as turning devices on or off, potentially using WiFi or other connectivity for remote access. It aims to provide a scalable solution that can be expanded to include sensors for temperature, motion, or security features. Based on common implementations, it might use technologies like Python for scripting or integrate with platforms like Arduino or ESP8266 for hardware interaction.

The Automation_Code file serves as the main entry point. Without direct access to the code, this README assumes typical home automation logic, such as interfacing with relays or APIs for device control. If the code involves specific libraries or hardware, update this section with those details for accuracy.

## Features

- Remote device control: Manage appliances like lights and fans from a mobile app or web interface.
- Sensor integration: Potentially include environmental monitoring, such as temperature or humidity detection.
- Automation rules: Set schedules or triggers for automatic operation, like turning on lights at dusk.
- Security alerts: Basic notifications for unusual activity, enhancing home safety.

## Requirements

To run this project, you will need:
- C++ for scripting.
- Hardware components, such as an ESP8266 module, relays, or sensors like DHT for temperature.
- Libraries like requests for API calls or specific IoT frameworks.
- A stable WiFi connection for remote features.

## Usage

Execute the main script:

Configure settings within the code, such as WiFi credentials or device pins. For instance, use a mobile app like Blynk to send commands, or access a web dashboard for control. Test by toggling a connected light or checking sensor readings. Customize automation rules to fit your home setup, like scheduling fan operation based on time or temperature thresholds.

## Contributing

Contributions are encouraged to improve this home automation project. Fork the repository, add your enhancements (e.g., new sensor support), and submit a pull request. Please include comments in your code and follow standard Python conventions for readability.
